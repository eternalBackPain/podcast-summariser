# podcast-summariser

To summarise my jurisprudence lectures so that I don't have to listen to them. End goal is to intergrate with ChatGPT API and have a chatbot on the summarised audio text.

Issues with FormData and fs when sending audio files to the backend. Need to simplify teh API and test it on its own to check if the response is actually coded properly.
